In a separate Python file named 'my_devices.py', define a dictionary named
'rtr1' with the following key-value pairs: 
 
host = rtr1.domain.com
username = cisco
password = cisco123
device_type = cisco_ios

Import my_devices into this program, and print the rtr1 dictionary to the screen
using pprint.
